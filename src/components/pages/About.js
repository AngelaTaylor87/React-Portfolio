      <p> I am Angela Taylor, currently i'm enrolled as a part-time student at a Rice
                        University Coding Boot Camp, from Houston, Tx. At this time I am a beginner in this field, with hopes to
                        be a highly
                        proficient Web developer by the end of this course.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I enjoy life! I love to travel, swimming, bike rides, the company of family and
                        friends, and spend quality time with
                        my puppy.</p>
